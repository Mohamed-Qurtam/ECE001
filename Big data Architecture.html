Big data repositories have existed in many forms, often built by corporations with a special need.<br> Commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in the 1990s.<br> For many years, WinterCorp published the largest database report.<br>
Teradata Corporation in 1984 marketed the parallel processing DBC 1012 system.<br> Teradata systems were the first to store and analyze 1 terabyte of data in 1992. Hard disk drives were 2.5 GB in 1991<br> so the definition of big data continuously evolves according to Kryder's Law.<br> Teradata installed the first petabyte class RDBMS based system in 2007.<br> As of 2017, there are a few dozen petabyte class Teradata relational databases installed, the largest of which exceeds 50 PB.<br> Systems up until 2008 were 100% structured relational data. Since then, Teradata has added unstructured data types including XML, JSON, and Avro.<br>
In 2000, Seisint Inc. (now LexisNexis Risk Solutions) developed a C++-based distributed platform for data processing and querying<br> known as the HPCC Systems platform. This system automatically partitions, distributes, stores and delivers structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data<br> across multiple commodity servers. Users can write data processing pipelines and queries in a declarative dataflow programming language called ECL.<br> Data analysts working in ECL are not required to define data schemas upfront and can rather focus on the particular problem at hand,<br> reshaping data in the best possible manner as they develop the solution.<br> In 2004, LexisNexis acquired Seisint Inc. and their high-speed parallel processing platform and successfully utilized this platform to integrate the data systems of Choicepoint Inc.<br> when they acquired that company in 2008. In 2011, the HPCC systems platform was open-sourced under the Apache v2.0 License.<br>
2012 studies showed that a multiple-layer architecture is one option to address the issues that big data presents.<br> A distributed parallel architecture distributes data across multiple servers; these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds.<br> This type of architecture inserts data into a parallel DBMS, which implements the use of MapReduce and Hadoop frameworks.<br> This type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the end-user by using a front-end application server.<br>
The data lake allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management.<br> This enables quick segregation of data into the data lake, thereby reducing the overhead time.<br>
