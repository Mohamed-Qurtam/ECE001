The increase in the amount of data available presents both opportunities and problems.<br>
In general, having more data on oneâ€™s customers (and potential customers)<br> should allow companies to better tailor their products and marketing efforts<br> in order to create the highest level of satisfaction and repeat business.<br> Companies that are able to collect a large amount of data are provided with the opportunity to conduct deeper and richer analysis.<br>
While better analysis is a positive, big data can also create overload and noise.<br> Companies have to be able to handle larger volumes of data,<br> all the while determining which data represents signals compared to noise.<br> Determining what makes the data relevant becomes a key factor.<br>
Furthermore, the nature and format of the data can require special handling before it is acted upon.<br> Structured data, consisting of numeric values, can be easily stored and sorted.<br> Unstructured data, such as emails, videos, and text documents,<br> may require more sophisticated techniques to be applied before it becomes useful.<br>
