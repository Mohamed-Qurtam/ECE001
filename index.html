Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from,<br> or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex<br> to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.<br> Data with many cases (rows) offer greater statistical power,<br> while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns)<br> may lead to a higher false discovery rate.<br> Big data challenges include: capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing,<br> transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source.<br> Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.<br> When we handle big data, we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens.<br> Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software<br> to process within an acceptable time and value.<br>
